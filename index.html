                    See a catalog of highly technical projects
                    I have completed. From full-service websites
                    to financial analysis tools, I have done
                    most projects a person can think of. If you
                    don't see one you want, send me a message
                    and I will do it!

                <h3>Dynamic Experiences</h3>
                <p>
                    I immigrated to the United States in 2012.
                    During that time, I found new perspectives and
                    new talents that I continue to explore today.
                    One new talent was programming, which allows
                    me to automate and excel at tasks in the workplace.

                    I am not perfect and I have made mistakes
                    along the way. I also enjoy getting inspiration
                    from many sources including those around me.

                    just hang out, send me a message.
